# Alex's Developer Porfolio

This project I created after finishing my 6 month coding bootcamp at Redwood Code Academy. I built it using React. It showcases two of my favorite projects and my resume in pdf format. It's still a work in progress, but a good start so far.

## Deployment

I ended up buying the domain as my name to host the portfolio on. I delployed my portfolio using Netlify. Check out the live portfolio here: alexpartida.com.
